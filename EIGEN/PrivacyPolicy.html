                <p class="middle-white">Welcome to Red Bull, the completely unofficial, overly-hyped fan-powered web zone that absolutely, definitely is not run by Red Bull GmbH. This site was created by people who may or may not be drinking Red Bull right now, and while we’re not sponsored (or even noticed), we’re keeping the energy high and the disclaimers vague.<br><br>

                    This Privacy Policy exists because someone on the internet said we legally needed one. So here it is.<br><br>
                    
                    We only collect one thing: your email address. That’s it. If you typed it into our form, it’s chilling somewhere on our server with zero context and maximum vibes.<br><br>
                    
                    We promise not to do anything evil with it. We might use it to send fake updates, fan theories, and possibly invitations to underground Red Bull lookalike can conventions.<br><br>
                    
                    We do not sell, rent, lend, barter, trade, lease, or spiritually exchange your email with anyone. Your inbox is safe from everything except maybe overly enthusiastic fake newsletters.<br><br>
                    
                    We do not track you, spy on your mouse, or follow you through 37 tabs of browser chaos. No cookies (unless someone mails us actual cookies, in which case thank you).<br><br>
                    
                    You can ask us to delete your email at any time by emailing us at weArenot@realredbull.com. We’ll respond as soon as our imaginary legal team stops playing Rocket League.<br><br>
                    
                    This policy might change if we drink enough Red Bull to legally time travel. But until then, it’s set in fizzy stone.<br><br>
                    
                    Thanks for trusting us with your email. Now go back to pretending you’re part of the Red Bull racing crew—because we are too.
